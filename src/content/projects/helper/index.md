The project is a Firefox browser extension that includes features to enhance and optimize the workflow. The codebase consists of JavaScript with jQuery, HTML, and CSS. The extension builds upon existing work tools' functionality and introduces new features through custom developments. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in extension development as well as in network and website operations.\
Development commenced in April 2024 and is ongoing.
